#Hello Hello! 

So I've put together some options for flights + villas.   
Italy seems to be a huge pain for flight so I've has a look at some options for Spain:

### Barcelona 

Ryanair fly direct from Glasgow Prestwick.

The cheapest seems to be from Sunday 31st July to 7th Aug at around 130:

[insert ryanair flights] 

Some nice Villas around Barcelona.
Think it would be cool to chill outside and we can take a few day trips into Barcelona itself:

  Works out at 285 a room.   
  It doesn't have a pool but it really close to the beach

  This one has a pool but a bit further away from Barcelona   
  290 per room   


###Mallorca
  
Flights are around the same price as Barcelona but Villas seem to be much nicer.

 158 a room and looks really nice
