# Barcelona 

Ryanair fly direct from Glasgow Prestwick.

The cheapest seems to be from Sunday 31st July to 7th Aug at around 118:

Some nice Villas around Barcelona.
Think it would be cool to chill outside and we can take a few day trips into Barcelona itself:

  This one looks amazing and works out at 346 a room.
  That means two people to fly + room would be a total of 582.
  It's 1.5 hour from Barcelona and the beach though.
  It does have a pool though!
